# News-Genre-Classification
This project focuses on classifying news headlines into various genres, such as Politics, Business, and Sports, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used for this project was collected through web scraping from The Times of India and Hindustan Times.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a news headline. Classifiers are evaluated, and ensemble learning methods are implemented to improve performance.

## Key Features
- Data Collection: Web scraping from news sources like Times of India and Hindustan Times.
- Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, removing stop words, and transforming text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.
- Modeling: Multiple classifiers, including ensemble learning techniques, used to boost accuracy.
- Evaluation: An accuracy score is used as the evaluation metric.
- Dataset: 
> - Name->  TOI_News.csv
- Columns:
> - Headline->  The news headline text.
> - Genre->  The genre/category of the headline (e.g., Politics, Business, Sports).
